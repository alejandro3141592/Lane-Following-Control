This folder contains some ROS launch files, making it easier to run the whole environment needed.
- The [LaneDetectionPix2PixZed](https://github.com/alejandro3141592/Lane-Following-Control/blob/b18a5c8b64e61ad43f5392067dc2ae407a9829ae/launch/LaneDetectionPix2PixZed.launch) file, is the ultimate version of the project and the one that is used for the real tests. With this, we obtain the images from the Zed Camera,then we apply the Pix2Pix model to it, to draw the white lines, after that, we apply a line detection algorithm, and depending on the position of the lines, we compute an output for controlling the steering, and finally we send this output as a command to the vehicle.

- The [SimpleLaneDetectionOnVideo](https://github.com/alejandro3141592/Lane-Following-Control/blob/b18a5c8b64e61ad43f5392067dc2ae407a9829ae/launch/SimpleLaneDetectionOnVideo.launch) file is used when we are making some testing or demonstration with the vehicle over towers, so we can load a pre-recorded video, simulating that that is what the camera is seeing.

-   The [SimpleLaneDetectionOnZed](https://github.com/alejandro3141592/Lane-Following-Control/blob/b18a5c8b64e61ad43f5392067dc2ae407a9829ae/launch/SimpleLaneDetectionOnZed.launch) file is used when we want to test the algorithm without applying the Pix2Pix model, or when we want to simulate the ROS message of the Zed Cam wit a pre-recorded video.
