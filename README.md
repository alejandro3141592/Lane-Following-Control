# Lane-Following-Control

As a part of the project of develop an Autonomous Mobile Robot, a lane follower was implemented. Nevertheless, because in the campus where the car is supossed to drive exits a big amount of different escenarios and in a lot of the is complicated to implement a traditional line follower with tradicional porgramming, I decided to implement a Pix2Pix Arquitecture, wich consists in generate an image from a conditionated input, wich is also an image, and in this way achieving to obtain an image with the lines drawed, wich an human could easily infer.
